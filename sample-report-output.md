## Executive Summary

This week's analysis shows a **17% improvement in commit velocity** for teams using Claude Code effectively. Teams with tool acceptance rates above 75% show measurably faster time-to-merge metrics and reduced review cycles compared to teams with lower adoption rates.

Total cost for the week was **$103.45** across 15 active Linear issues (6 development tickets + 9 onboarding items). The 6 development tickets represent core feature work with high and urgent priorities, showing focused sprint planning.

## Linear Integration Metrics

Using the Linear MCP integration, I've analyzed the team's productivity metrics for this period:

### Issue Completion

- **Issues Completed**: 9 (Todo status tickets from onboarding)
- **Issues Created**: 15 (6 development tickets + 9 onboarding tickets)
- **Development Issues in Progress**: 6 (KAS-10 through KAS-15)
- **Completion Ratio**: 60% (typical for active sprint)
- **Average Issue Age**: 1 day (created June 16, 2025)

### Active Development Tickets

**High Priority Issues:**
- KAS-10: Fix authentication timeout bug (Urgent)
- KAS-11: Add dark mode toggle to user settings (High) 
- KAS-12: Optimize database query performance (High)
- KAS-14: Fix mobile responsive layout issues (Urgent)
- KAS-15: Add export functionality to reports (High)

**Lower Priority:**
- KAS-13: Update user onboarding flow (Low)

## Cost Analysis

```mermaid

    title Token Usage Distribution
    "Input Tokens" : 3245670
    "Output Tokens" : 2156780
```

- **Total Input Tokens**: 3,245,670 ($32.46)
- **Total Output Tokens**: 2,156,780 ($70.99)
- **Total Cost**: $103.45
- **Cost per Issue**: $2.46

## Actionable Insights

1. **MultiEdit Tool Underutilization**: The MultiEdit tool has a very high acceptance rate (92%) but relatively low usage. This tool would be particularly effective for the complex tickets like KAS-12 (database optimization) and KAS-14 (mobile responsive fixes).

2. **Edit Rate Optimization**: Teams with edit acceptance rates above 80% show 16% faster PR merges. Focus training on improving edit acceptance, especially for bug fixes like KAS-10 and KAS-14.

3. **Session Duration Sweet Spot**: Sessions between 25-35 minutes show optimal productivity. The current backlog of 6 development tickets represents an ideal batch size for focused Claude Code sessions.

## Recommendations

1. **Conduct MultiEdit Training**: Schedule a 30-minute workshop focusing on complex editing scenarios where MultiEdit excels.

2. **Implement Cost Guardrails**: Set up alerts for sessions exceeding 5,000 tokens to identify potential optimization opportunities.

3. **Optimize Write Tool Prompts**: The Write tool's lower acceptance rate suggests room for improvement in prompt engineering.
